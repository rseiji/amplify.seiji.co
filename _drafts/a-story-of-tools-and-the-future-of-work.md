Why Notion was built:

> Google Docs made typewriters multiplayer. Dropbox brought file cabinets to the cloud. But conceptually, they evolved little beyond their Industrial Revolution ancestors.  
> We duct-tape everything together with emails, copy/paste, and countless open tabs.

How they are building it:

> We want to break away from today's toolsâ€”and bring back some of the ideas of those early pioneers. \[...\] Solve your problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

I love Notion.
