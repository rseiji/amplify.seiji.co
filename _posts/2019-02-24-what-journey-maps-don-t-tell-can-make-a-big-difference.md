> To be confident in our choice, we need to be more capable to see importance and cause-and-effects in our journey maps. So we might consider to include the followings in their layout:

> - Distinguish the differences in the length of steps
> - Indicate of pauses or breaks in the progress
> - Make reoccurring actions and loops visible
> - See cause-and-effects across steps, not just in-between

> These changes might make journey maps a bit more complex, but it would pay for the information they deliver.
