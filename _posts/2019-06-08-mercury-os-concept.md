[Jason Yuan](https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289 "Introducing Mercury OS") about his concept:

> Mercury rejects the Desktop Metaphor and App Ecosystems as fundamentally inhumane. Inspired by Jef Raskinâ€™s principles, Mercury seeks to deliver a more humane take on human-computer interaction.

The concept feels much like mindset you adopt when using command line interfaces.
