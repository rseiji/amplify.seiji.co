> For any given uncertainty about the future — whether that’s risk, opportunity, or growth — **we \[futurists\] tend to think in the short- and long-term simultaneously**. To do this, I use a framework that measures certainty and charts actions, rather than simply marking the passage of time as quarters or years. That’s why **my timelines aren’t actually lines at all — they are cones**.

The "cone" has two axis: Data, evidence, and certainty / time. Area split in 4, from less to more in the first axis: Tatics (1-2y), Strategy (2-5y), Vision(5-10y), System-level evolution (10+y).
