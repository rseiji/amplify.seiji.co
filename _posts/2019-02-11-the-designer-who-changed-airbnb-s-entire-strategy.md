Rebecca Sinclair on design influencing core strategy:
> You can’t know the future in such a fast-moving organization or in a global market. And, when you’re truly disrupting, you don’t want to be limited by what you think your company can be right now. Snow White (customer journey storyboarding) brought human-centered design to all levels of the organization, and it is still used and shared today.

On staying ahead in a changing market:
> You can’t build products that people want without a strong point of view, so understanding that Airbnb's product was the trip gave the team the right constraints to focus on innovation that rolled up to our brand promise -- even as the markets shifts.

And a final advice:
> Take responsibility to create something better than the customer could have imagined. They are the inspiration, but you are the creator.
