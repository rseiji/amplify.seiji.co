Jonah LehrerJonah Lehrer on learning:
> unless we experience the unpleasant symptoms of being wrong – that surge of Pe (error positivity) activity a few hundred milliseconds after the error, directing our attention to the very thing we'd like to ignore – the mind will never revise its models. We'll keep on making the same mistakes, forsaking self-improvement for the sake of self-confidence. Samuel Beckett had the right attitude: “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.”
