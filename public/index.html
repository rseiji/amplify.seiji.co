    <p>Designers as curators:
&gt; In the future, designers will train their AI tools to solve design problems by creating models based on their preferences.</p>

<p>The ongoing era of superstar designers:
&gt; As AI-driven parametric design enables designers to quickly and easily create millions of variations of a design, most designers’ productivity will dramatically increase. <a href="but">&hellip;</a> until AI is capable of surprising us with completely novel ideas, superstar designers and companies that invest in them will continue to dominate, increasing the value of design brands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can see the potential for a future where our personal AI assistants, armed with a deep understanding of our influences, heroes, and inspirations, constantly critique our work, suggesting ideas and areas of improvement. A world where problem-solving bots help us see a problem from a variety of perspectives, through different frameworks. Where simulated users test things we’ve designed to see how they will perform in a variety of contexts and suggest improvements, before anything is even built. Where A/B testing bots are constantly looking for ways to suggest minor performance optimizations to our design work.</p>

<p>How do we retrain a significant percentage of the workforce to occupations that are more resilient to technological automation and what are the characteristics of these automation-proof occupations?</p>

<p>For how long will we be able to stay ahead of the gradually accelerating capabilities of automation systems?</p>
