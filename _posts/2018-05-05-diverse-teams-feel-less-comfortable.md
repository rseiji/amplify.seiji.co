David Rock, Heidi Grant and Jacqui Grey:

> If [...] leaders can recognize that the debate and unfamiliarity that come with diversity is an important catalyst for creativity and deep thinking, they will invite it and celebrate it. And very likely, the organization — and everyone in it — will reap the rewards.

A welcoming, respectful and safe team is able to deal values differences. Let everyone feel included in the team and organization, no matter what.
