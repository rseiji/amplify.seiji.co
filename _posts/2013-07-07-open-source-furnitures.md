OPEN SOURCE FURNITURESO estúdio japonês Nosigner projetou o escritório da Mozilla Japan com mobiliário open-source:

They designed all furnitures based on the idea of Open Source. They used general products and uploaded all drawings to the website. Therefore, these designs might also be able to call the “open source furniture" so to speak. Because these designs enable everyone to make functional office furnitures inexpensively.
