From MDN web docs:
> Why a re-introduction? Because JavaScript is notorious for being [the world's most misunderstood programming language](http://crockford.com/javascript/). It is often derided as being a toy, but beneath its layer of deceptive simplicity, powerful language features await. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.
