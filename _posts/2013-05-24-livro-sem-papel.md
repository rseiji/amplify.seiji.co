Livro sem papelTodd Sattersten do BizBookLab:

We need some new language that describes what happens and, more importantly, what is possible when words are separated from the paper. Those two things need to be separated so we can build systems and infrastructures that support the new capabilities of the technology.
For several decades, what we know today as a “car” was referred to as a “horseless carriage.” It was easier to describe this new invention as what it was not, rather than what it was.

O que dá para fazer com livros que são de papel?
