&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here in my home office, the line between pleasure and duty is blurred. Weekend or weekday, there is no difference to me. Nobody counts my hours. My work is also my hobby. It takes as long as it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well written reflection on working from a home office.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="working" /><summary type="html">Mike Sager:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AI and the future of design</title><link href="http://annotations.seiji.co/2017/04/22/ai-and-design.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI and the future of design" /><published>2017-04-22T18:00:26-03:00</published><updated>2017-04-22T18:00:26-03:00</updated><id>http://annotations.seiji.co/2017/04/22/ai-and-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://annotations.seiji.co/2017/04/22/ai-and-design.html">&lt;p&gt;Designers as curators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the future, designers will train their AI tools to solve design problems by creating models based on their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing era of superstar designers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As AI-driven parametric design enables designers to quickly and easily create millions of variations of a design, most designers’ productivity will dramatically increase. […] (but) until AI is capable of surprising us with completely novel ideas, superstar designers and companies that invest in them will continue to dominate, increasing the value of design brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can see the potential for a future where our personal AI assistants, armed with a deep understanding of our influences, heroes, and inspirations, constantly critique our work, suggesting ideas and areas of improvement. A world where problem-solving bots help us see a problem from a variety of perspectives, through different frameworks. Where simulated users test things we’ve designed to see how they will perform in a variety of contexts and suggest improvements, before anything is even built. Where A/B testing bots are constantly looking for ways to suggest minor performance optimizations to our design work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How do we retrain a significant percentage of the workforce to occupations that are more resilient to technological automation and what are the characteristics of these automation-proof occupations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For how long will we be able to stay ahead of the gradually accelerating capabilities of automation systems?&lt;/p&gt;
