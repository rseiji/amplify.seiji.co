> We’re a band that makes electronic music and you’re listening to our new album, George & Jonathan III. We’ve developed highly advanced music videos that let you see all the notes we used in our songs. Some songs may be special.

The music is great. In associated with the light trails visualization the experience is incredibly hypnotic. You are going to spend more time on it than you think. Bonus whack-a-moles visualization at `Puppy Love` track,
