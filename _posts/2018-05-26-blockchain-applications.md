>It will be something that can take advantage of blockchain’s fundamental strengths: it will be a decentralized application whose participants don’t necessarily trust each other, and that nevertheless requires an accurate log of all the events that take place.

Applications examples: digital identity, power distribution, shipping, internet of things, health care, education, and games.
